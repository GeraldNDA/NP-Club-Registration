# NP-Club-Registration
The front end of a prospective club registration app for North Park. This app was made the ICS3UR class but due to teacher strikes and other administrative issues, the app didn't get completely completed. This app uses only vanilla JS.
## To be Updated
1. Add Graphs to statistics page
2. Add better placeholders (Accross site)
3. Make each club work and add ability to add/remove clubs

Any suggestions are always appreciated. Email me.
